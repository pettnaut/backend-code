## Getting started
We are using heroku for development. So is easiest to test the code in your local enviroment.
#### Install the Heroku CLI

Download and install the  [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line).

If you haven't already, log in to your Heroku account and follow the prompts to create a new SSH public key.
```
$ heroku login
```
Clone the project 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/pettnaut/backend-code.git
```
Go to your project
```
$ cd backend-code
```
Create your own heroku project
```
$ heroku create
```
A random name for your project will be assigned. 
Now deploy your code:
```
$ git push heroku master
```
The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:
```
$ heroku ps:scale web=1
```
Add a database 
```
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```
Now you have to populate this database with test entries. We have prepare a script that you can use. For do that, open the postgresql on heroku:
```
$ heroku pg:psql
```
Into the new terminal, copy an paste the content inside the `init.sql` at root directory.

That's it. You are done! You can access to your test api running this hands on command from heroku:
```
$ heroku open
```
It will open your browser and show you the url of your api!
